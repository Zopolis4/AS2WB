Automatic Save to Wayback Machine

This is the repository for the Automatic Save to Wayback Machine userscript/chrome extension.

This script is heavily based on ATRescue's [script](https://archiveteam.org/index.php?title=User:ATrescue/AutoWB.js), but changed to use the standard xhr instead of the GM_xhr, in order to allow compatibility with chrome when not run in a userscript manager.

The userscript can be found [here](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/426028-automatic-save-to-wayback-machine)
