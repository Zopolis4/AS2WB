Automatic Save to Wayback Machine

This is the repository for the Automatic Save to Wayback Machine userscript/chrome extension.

This script was originally based on [ATRescue's script](https://archiveteam.org/index.php?title=User:ATrescue/AutoWB.js), but has since undergone many changes and now uses none of the original code.

The userscript can be found [here](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/426028-automatic-save-to-wayback-machine), the Chrome extension [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/autosave-to-wayback-machi/defmcmdgnplidnoilmeleeglnmjkalnk) and the Firefox extension [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/autosave-to-wayback-machine/).
