Automatic Save to Wayback Machine

This is the repository for the Automatic Save to Wayback Machine userscript/chrome extension.

This script is heavily based on ATRescue's [script](https://archiveteam.org/index.php?title=User:ATrescue/AutoWB.js), but changed to use the standard xhr instead of the GM_xhr, in order to allow compatibility with chrome when not run in a userscript manager.

Folders and Files:
AS2WB- Unpacked, unmimified chrome extension
AS2WB (Minified)- Unpacked chrome extension
AS2WB.js- Normal version of the usercript
AS2WB (Commented).js- Version of the userscript with some commented documentation
readme.md- Hi!
